## Key Takeaways
- **Ethereum (L1):** Most mature, best for high-value DeFi, NFTs, and regulated use cases, but expensive and slow.
- **Solana:** Best for high-throughput, low-fee use cases (payments, gaming, fast DeFi), but younger and has had outages.
- **Sui:** Innovative, high TPS, Move language, ideal for gaming and object-centric apps, but new and less proven.
- **Optimism/Arbitrum:** Best for scaling ETH dApps with lower fees, easy migration from ETH, inherits ETH security, but still depend on L1 for finality and may have rollup-specific delays.
